Feature: Add new tasks to a todo list

  In order to avoid having to remember things that need doing
  As a forgetful person
  I want to be able to record what I need to do in a place where I won't forget about them

  Scenario: Adding an item to an empty list
    Given that James has an empty todo list
    When he adds 'Buy some milk' to his list
    Then 'Buy some milk' should be recorded in his list
